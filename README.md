# Atliq Product Sales Analysis

## Goal
In this project, we analyzed sales data from AtliQ Hardware to identify top-performing products and categories.  
We also examined how product popularity changed over time across different markets.

In addition, we tested the hypothesis:  
**"Sales in the 'India' sub-zone are significantly higher in each category than in the 'NA' region."**

## Analysis Steps
- Analyzed sales volume for each product individually
- Explored the relationship between sales, revenue, and profit
- Assessed how sales trends changed over time by product category
- Compared category sales across different sub-zones
- Investigated seasonal patterns in annual sales
- Performed hypothesis testing on regional sales differences

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats)
- SQLite (local database)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for additional visualization)

## Files
- `Feklina_final_project.ipynb` — main analysis notebook
- `atliq_db.sqlite3` — database used in the project
Due to GitHub's file size limit, the SQLite database is not stored in this repository.   
You can download it from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X-QTf7pSKfsDMPZCCa2oDrC6SbjHZb2t/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the project folder to run the analysis.

## Notes
This project was part of my final assignment during the TripleTen Data Analytics course. The dataset is fictional and provided for educational purposes.
