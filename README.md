# Atliq Product Sales Analysis

## Goal
In this project, we analyzed data from AtliQ Hardware and analyzed the products.
We have described the products and product categories that are the best selling. We also researched how the popularity of these products changed over time in different markets.

In addition, the hypothesis "sales in the 'India' region are significantly higher in each category than sales in the regions India and NA" was tested.
India and NA are two of the most popular sub_zones.

## What we've done
- looked at the number of sales for each product separately,
- studied the relationship between the number of sales and revenue/profit,
- assessed how the number of sales for each category of goods changed over time,
- looked at the sales of each category separately in different 'sub_zones',
- studied whether there is seasonality in sales during the year,
- tested the hypothesis: "sales in the 'India' region are significantly higher in each category than sales in the regions India and 'NA'".

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQLite (local database)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for additional visualization)

## Files
- `atliq_analysis.ipynb` — main analysis notebook
- `atliq_db.sqlite3` — database used in the project
Due to GitHub's file size limit, the SQLite database is not stored in this repository.   
You can download it from [this Google Drive link]([https://your-link-here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X-QTf7pSKfsDMPZCCa2oDrC6SbjHZb2t/view?usp=sharing)) and place it in the project folder to run the analysis.

## Notes
This project was part of my final assignment during the TripleTen Data Analytics course. The dataset is fictional and provided for educational purposes.
